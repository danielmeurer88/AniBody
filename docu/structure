basic structure of the Anibody documentation

Table of Content

* Still In Progress
* Teaching Method -> Learning by short examples, playing around with the code then discover changes
* Requirements
    - Understanding of JavaScript, a little bit of HTML,
    - jQuery (at the moment)
* Idea of the framework
    - allowing interactive animations with less writing effort in a short period of time, HTML5-conform and hence cross-browser friendly
* Anibody in a nutshell
    - The beating heart of the engine is the (Game)-Loop, which beats by default with a frequence of 25 frames per second
    - in one Frame, the engine processes the user input, updates itself and draws every object that needs to be drawn
    - create project-specific components with the functions ProcessInput(), Update() and Draw() or use predefined components and add them to the engine's Loop
    - User events like pressed keys, mouse movements or touch input will be recorded and can be used at any time or own functions can be attached to listen for them.

* Frequently used objects
    - You will often read about a Callback-object. That is a POJO (Plain old JavaScript Object :D ), which holds an anonymous function and optionally two objects and a boolean
     It's an object, which capsulates a function, that will be called by the engine, refering to one object and the arguments of said function will be determined by the second object and the boolean
     
     for example:
     <code>
     var player = {killGoblin : function(){
     } };
     
     var func = function(arg1, arg2){
        console.log(arg1);
        this.killGoblin(arg2);
     }
     
     var callbackobject = { function: func, that: player, parameter: ["Something Epic!", 100], useApply:true }
	 // or use Function.getCallbackObject()  ((own ECMAScript-Extension))
	 var callbackobject = func.getCallbackObject(player, ["Something Epic!", 100], true);
     
     // Callback is called by this function
     Anibody.CallObject( callbackobject );
     
    </code>
    
* Anibody classes
    - There are 4 major classes
        - Anibody: it's the engine
        - EngineObject: The root class for most objects, which finds its way to the loop. Components, which are made to run in the background, inherit from this class.
        - ABO: The class inherits from EngineObject. Components, which are made to be rendered on the canvas. (Graphical, visual components)
        - Widget: This class inherits from ABO: Components, which are made to be rendered on the canvas in the foreground. These are spontanious objects, mostly created as a result of a user action and are not added to the Loop. A widget can be (mis-) used to implement a custom ProcessInput(), Update() or Draw()-function
        
* Packages

All classes, provided by the anibody framework, are packed into packages.
The advantage:
structure hints of their function. 
The disadvantage: using these classes means using very long class names like:

<code>
var spline = new Anibody.visual.Spline();
</code>

therefore: import possibility like:

<code>
var spline = new Anibody.visual.Spline();

Anibody.import(Anibody.visual.Spline);

var spline2 = new Spline();

// import using an alias
Anibody.import(Anibody.shapes.Rectangle, "Rect");

var rect = new Rect(10,10, 200, 50);
</code>
